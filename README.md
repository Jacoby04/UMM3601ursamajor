##Initial goals / plans:
- Set up project / environment and make placeholder site.
- __Story__: Logging in with Google account.
- __Story__: Create submission (form).
- __Story__?: Store information from / for submission.


##Predicted Complications:
- Balance between database and Google drive for storage.
- Filtering out non UMM/UMN Google logins.
- Figuring out how access to api stuff is restricted on a per-user basis?
-- Until we figure this out, it seems as though we will be unable to make use of the database.
