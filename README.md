####360NoCode
- Joseph T. 
- Peter H.
- Nic R.
- Jacob O.
- Mitch F.

##Schedule:
- Mitch: Weekends, late.
- Peter: Anytime after 4, except Sunday.
- Jacob: After 4, most weekends.
- Joseph: pretty much any time.
- Nic: Anytime after 4, not really Monday nights.

##Initial goals / plans:
- Set up project / environment and make placeholder site.
- __Story__: Logging in with Google account.
- __Story__: Create submission (form).
- __Story__?: Store information from / for submission.


##Predicted Complications:
- Balance between database and Google drive for storage.
- Filtering out non UMM/UMN Google logins.
- Figuring out how access to api stuff is restricted on a per-user basis?
-- Until we figure this out, it seems as though we will be unable to make use of the database.

##Progress Report 10-14
- Joe pulled the submission form from KK and update it to work with our app
- Jacob updated angular to store the submission data within our DB
- Mitch integrated the sign in with google
- Nic and Mitch updated the routing to be user specific and contain the submission form
- Peter updated CSS for the home page and the submission form
